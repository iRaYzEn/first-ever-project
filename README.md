# First Ever Project

this project indeed got me to a lot of trouble i made it in 2021 technically i was 14
so, i showed it to my family and i got smacked and my pc has been taken from me and the only thing i did wrong is that i was passion about programming!!
i have been struggling since then and here we are

btw i made the project by following along with this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzHSjcR-HnW9tnxyuye8KbF
i didn't learn a lot though, but it was a really fun experience 

A live version of the site: https://irayzen.github.io/first-ever-project/

and yeah i found out about programming by watching Alzero web school videos so thank you if you are reading this now i didn't learn a lot from you but i found out about this career
because of you so think you
